## xNetHack 7.0 Changelog

This is a major version of xNetHack. It is based directly on xNetHack 6.0, and
is a fork off the vanilla NetHack 3.7.0 development version release.

The most recent vanilla commit incorporated into xNetHack is dd6ed502. Note that
because 3.7.0 is still in development status, xNetHack may contain major changes
including new monsters, new objects, themed rooms, and other things *not*
documented in this file or other xNetHack changelogs. See doc/fixes37.0 for the
DevTeam's changes.

The xNetHack page at the NetHackWiki, https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/XNetHack,
attempts to describe these changes in a way that's better formatted and more
friendly to players. However, the wiki page might be out of date; in case of
conflicting information, this changelog and others in this directory are more
up-to-date than the wiki page, and the commit messages are more up-to-date than
this changelog.

On top of any changes made by the NetHack devteam on 3.7, and any changes
made in previous xNetHack versions, xNetHack 7.0 contains the following
changes:

### Gameplay changes

- 5% of humanoid non-lord A monsters (Angels and Aleaxes) generate with a harp,
  which is magic 20% of the time.
- 1/40 of dwarves in the Mines and 1/8 of dwarves outside the Mines generate
  with d3 booze potions.
- French fried and deep fried tins give more nutrition (80 and 100
  respectively.)
- New random tin flavor "stale", giving only 25 nutrition.
- Skeletons rarely drop bone skeleton keys.
- Blowing up a bag of holding gives some experience points, identifies the bag
  of holding, and identifies the wand of cancellation if that is the cause of
  the explosion.
- Ghosts will not make themselves uninvisible in an attempt to frighten you if
  you are already paralyzed.
- Elven ring mail, in its default copper form, provides 2 AC, and provides 4 AC
  if made of mithril.
- Covetous monsters will attempt to equip the item they covet if it comes into
  their possession and it is equippable.
- Itlachiayaque replaces the Orb of Detection as the Archeologist quest
  artifact. It is a gold shield of reflection that confers fire resistance
  and warning when carried and reflection when worn. Archeologists do not get
  a spellcasting penalty for wearing it. When invoked, it either summons a
  stinking cloud, identical to a scroll of the same beatitude, or you can gaze
  into it for the same effect as a crystal ball.
- Monsters can throw potions of oil as an offensive item. Typically they light
  them so that they explode on contact, but a confused monster may forget to do
  this.
- If you are hit by an unlit potion of oil, you get covered in oil and your
  fingers become slippery.
- Schliemann replaces the Minion of Huhetotl as the Archeologist quest nemesis.
  He is a human, and unlike other quest nemeses does not warp. He carries a
  pick-axe and a number of potions of oil to throw at you.
- The Archeologist quest has received a full overhaul:
  - The home, locate, goal, and filler levels are all replaced. The lower filler
    levels use an all-new level generator implemented entirely in Lua.
  - The story of the quest is changed. It's now a bit like a mash-up of Raiders
    of the Lost Ark and National Treasure: the location of Itlachiayaque has
    just been uncovered, and Schliemann and his better equipped team are trying
    to get it first! Unlike the player, they have no qualms about being ruthless
    and destructive in their eagerness to get there first.
  - Enemy-wise, the quest is a lot more mummy-heavy than it used to be, with
    human mummies in particular appearing a lot in the tomb in the second half
    of the quest.
  - Much of the quest loot consists of gold or other precious metal variants of
    regular items. (To this end, gold is now a valid material on normally-wooden
    items.)
  - Level sounds of explosions appear on the lower floors of the quest as you
    and Schliemann's team converge on Itlachiayaque.
  - Monster generation probabilities in the quest are now 55% human mummy, 14%
    random M, 17% random S, 14% random monster. (Not exact percentages.)
- Mummies now have a touch attack that inflicts withering, a new status effect.
  Withering has the following effects:
  - Every turn, a withering creature loses 1 or 2 hit points (0 or 1 if it
    regenerates), until the withering times out.
  - Withering creatures do not regenerate HP like normal, though items such as
    healing potions work the same to restore HP.
  - Creatures that die to withering attacks do not leave a corpse.
  - When the player is withering, a "Wither" status is shown on the status line.
    Status hilites can be used to configure this status like normal. It's also
    covered under 'major-troubles' in status hilites.
  - Prayer can fix withering, but unicorn horns cannot. Life-saving also does
    not cure it.
  - The various mummies inflict increasingly higher durations of withering as
    they increase in difficulty.
  - Certain chests are trapped in such a way that they spawn a number of mummies
    around you when triggered.
- You can #rub silver items while withering to reduce the remaining duration:
  - The amount of withering duration cancelled generally equals the total weight
    of the rubbed items. E.g. a weight-11 silver dagger will shorten withering
    by up to 11 turns.
  - This corrodes and/or destroys the silver items in the process. Each
    application of the silver causes 1 level of corrosion per 1/4 of the
    object's weight. If it goes past thoroughly corroded it disintegrates.
  - Items that are not subject to corrosion (e.g. the silver wand/ring) just get
    destroyed, regardless of how much withering they stopped.
  - Erodeproof silver and artifacts are not protected from corrosion or
    destruction.
  - The Bell of Opening cannot corrode or be destroyed, so using it to fix
    withering instead uses up its charges, and it won't work when out of
    charges.
- It is impossible to destroy a metal box or chest by forcing it.
- The Oracle may generate with a potion of hallucination.

### Interface changes

- Upon first entering the bottom Sokoban level, you get a message about grooves
  on the floor.
- Shopkeepers address certain players with a role-specific title, such as
  Knights or high-level Monks or Healers.
- The "You hear someone cursing shoplifters" message uses a shopkeeper's real
  name if you have visited their shop previously.
- Monks will stop seeing "You feel guilty" messages after eating meat enough
  times.
- The levels with the stairs to the Mines, Sokoban, and Vlad's Tower have
  special ambient level sounds. The Sokoban and Vlad ones only persist until you
  have finished the first level of Sokoban and killed Vlad, respectively.
- Swap the chaotic and unaligned altar colors to be in line with vanilla:
  chaotic is now black and unaligned red.
- For Junethack, begin recording quest completion (returning to one's leader
  with the quest artifact) as "completed_quest" in the achieveX xlogfile field.

### Architectural changes

- New functions:
  - sokoban_solved()
  - arti_starts_with_the()
  - unknown_bones()
- Implement covetous_nonwarper(), a macro that controls whether a covetous
  monster should not warp or use the other code in tactics(), and should behave
  like a normal monster.
- Allow specification of "waiting" on monsters in level file, which makes them
  wait until you're in visual range before moving.
- Refactor mktrap()'s mazeflag argument into a general flags field, and add a
  flag that disables generating a spider on a web. Also allow specification of
  "no_spider_on_web" in a table-form des.trap() command that passes this flag.
- New struct monst fields mwither (byte) and mwither_from_u (bit).
- Artifacts that warn against a monster class are properly supported with a new
  g.context.warntype.obj_mlet field.
