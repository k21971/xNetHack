/*
 * This file used to contain the support code for the Rogue level.
 * In xNetHack, this level has been removed thus making the code no longer
 * needed. For a while, this file was just removed entirely.
 * However, I've gotten tired of fixing merge conflicts introduced in various
 * system build files due to the removal of extralev.c and thus extralev.o,
 * which is frequently hardcoded along with all the other source files. So
 * I've brought back extralev.c even though it contains no code.
